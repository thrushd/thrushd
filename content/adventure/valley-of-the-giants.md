### Summary

A truly gorgeous hike through 51 acres of BLM protected old growth. Although getting there is an adventure in itself. The road is mostly maintained, but can be muddy and potholed in places. Also watch out for lifted trucks containing hunters pretending they are Speed Racer.

I planned to record the whole route leaving the trailhead, but got sidetracked so it's incomplete. Should help a little bit with navigation, as google maps will mislead you (I know from experience).

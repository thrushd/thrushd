### Summary

A nice day hike for the 'off the beaten path' crowd. Takes about 1/2hr to get to the trailhead from OR-34 on a fairly nice gravel road. Right from the gate it is very overgrown, expect the going to be slow. Anytime other than summer also expect to get soaked wading through damp foliage. About half way up the road clears and the going is nice and steady. At the top there are the remains of an old watchtower, just some concrete and rebar though.

This is a project I assisted with as an undergraduate researcher in [mLab](https://www.mlabrobotics.com/) at OSU. I contributed all of the mechanical design and fabrication of the mixing head used to mix the silicone. The vast bulk of the rest of the work, and all of the actual science, was conducted by [Steph Walker](http://walkersteph.work/). An extremely talented graduate student completing her dual Ph.D in material science and robotics.

For my senior capstone I opted to create my own projet, which was a 6 axis robotic arm and 4 dof gripper for the OSU Robotics Club Mars Rover Team. This was a monumental amount of work, spanning over 9 months and taking thousands of hours between myself and my two teammates, Joel Goodman and [Bryan Cmelak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-cmelak-a7126b112).

This arm and gripper were used in the 2018 [Canadian International Rover Challenge (CIRC)](https://circ.cstag.ca/archive/), where we took 1st place.

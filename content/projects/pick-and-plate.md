This is a device I designed and build while working at the [Sinnhuber Aquatic Research Laboratory Tanguay Lab](http://tanguaylab.com/) along with my friend and coworker [Corwin Perren](https://www.caperren.com/).

When researching toxicology with zebrafish it is necessary at a certain stage of their development to place the embryo in a well plate.

This was initially done by hand, with very sad undergraduates. A previous device had been commissioned, but cost on the order of $250k and was the size of a refrigerator. On top of that it was unreliable and hard to calibrate.

We were hired by the lab to develop a small and affordable device to supersede the previous generation. I designed many prototypes and learned a lot about mechanical design, GD&T, machining, and project development.

In the end we had a device that cost under $10k with a footprint of a little over a cubic foot.

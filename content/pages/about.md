Title: About
Author: Dylan Thrush

I'm a mechanical engineer with a bachelors in mechanical engineering from Oregon State University. I am currently working at [Agility Robotics](http://www.agilityrobotics.com) building humanoid robots.

This website is a combonation of a portfolio & dump of other random stuff I like.

When I'm not working I like to build stuff, hang out with my dog, or be outside.
